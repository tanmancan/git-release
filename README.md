# Git Release - Create releases with auto generated release message

## Personal Access Token

You will need a personal access token to authenticate with github. [How to generate token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)

## Auto-generate Release Message

Using the `Auto Generate Release Message` field, you can generate release notes based on commit messages. Choose a start and end date, and all commit messages within these date ranges will be used to generate a release message. If no end date is provided, it will use the most recent commit as the end point.

## Run Locally
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
